We picked use case 1: Predict stock market price for TESLA.

We believe that a regression algorithm is best for this scenario because we don't need to group the data into categories/labels, but instead predict a continuous value.

We are using regression to predict a continuous target variable.

Problems like price predictions are solved using regression.
